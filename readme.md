## Description
Track all the stats you need. That's the goal of **AJdG Matomo Tracker**. And it doesn't get any more simple than that.
While other plugins are bloated with all kinds of barely-used features or add bulky dashboards. **AJdG Matomo Tracker** does not.

Easily add the Matomo tracking code to your websites footer in under a minute with only a few clicks. Optionally extend the tracker with some useful features that both help you understand your visitors better and help you optimize the effectiveness of your website, and even SEO.

**AJdG Matomo Tracker** is designed to be barebones but still provide a complete experience for the majority of people.
Collect all the stats you need via the built-in Matomo tracking code.
Easily track dead links or in-links that end up on 404 error pages so you can effectively take action and fix those issues. As a result, Google will like you more!

Do you use RSS and Atom feeds? Ever wondered how effective they are? Yeah, me too!
With **AJdG Matomo Tracker** you can track incoming clicks from your RSS and Atom feeds.

Matomo is a great tool if you don't want to use Jetpack Stats, WP-Statistics and especially Google Analytics.
Or simply if you want a second opinion. On my own websites I've used both Jetpack Stats and Matomo - Ofcourse I used **AJdG Matomo Tracker** to add the Matomo tracking code to my footer.
Matomo can replace Google Analytics. If you use their self-hosted solution all data you record is yours without big data watching over your shoulder.

No nonsense, just stats tracking!

**AJdG Matomo Tracker** works with both self-hosted (on premise) and Matomo Cloud installations.
